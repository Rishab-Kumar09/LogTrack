## üí° How to Use These Files:

### Step 1: Download
- Click any link above
- Download the `.log` file to your computer
- Save it somewhere easy to find (like `Downloads/`)

### Step 2: Check Format
LogTrack expects **Apache/Nginx Combined Log Format**:
```
IP - - [timestamp] "METHOD /path HTTP/1.1" STATUS BYTES "-" "User-Agent"
```

If the file format looks different, you might need to:
- Try a different file from the source
- Or stick with our custom test files in `examples/`

### Step 3: Test
1. Go to https://log-track.netlify.app
2. Login (admin/password123)
3. Upload the downloaded file
4. Check results!

## üö® If Files Don't Work:

Some real-world logs might:
- Have different formats (W3C, IIS, etc.)
- Be too large (>5MB might be slow)
- Have encoding issues

**Solution:** Use our curated test files in `examples/` folder - they're guaranteed to work! ‚úÖ

## üì¶ Alternative: Generate Your Own

If you have access to a web server, you can also:

### Apache Server:
```bash
# Access logs usually in:
/var/log/apache2/access.log
```

### Nginx Server:
```bash
# Access logs usually in:
/var/log/nginx/access.log
```

### Local Development Server:
If you run a local server (XAMPP, WAMP, MAMP), check:
- `C:\xampp\apache\logs\access.log` (Windows)
- `/Applications/XAMPP/logs/access.log` (Mac)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:

1. **Privacy:** Never upload logs containing real user data or sensitive information!
2. **Format:** LogTrack is designed for Apache/Nginx combined format
3. **Size:** Keep files under 1-2MB for best performance
4. **Test First:** Always test with our sample files first to ensure the app works

---

## üéØ Recommended Testing Path:

1. **Start Local:** Use `examples/realistic-normal-day.log` (you know it works!)
2. **Try Public Data:** Download from GitHub sample_log_files repo
3. **Compare Results:** See how real vs synthetic logs differ
4. **Demo Ready:** Use curated examples for presentations
