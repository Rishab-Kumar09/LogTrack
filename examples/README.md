## üß™ Testing Strategy

### For Quick Testing:
1. Start with `sample-normal.log` (should be clean)
2. Then try `sample-attacks.log` (should trigger all 6 rules)

### For Demo/Presentation:
1. **Clean baseline:** `realistic-normal-day.log`
2. **Show detection:** `brute-force-attack.log`
3. **Complex scenario:** `data-exfiltration.log`

### For Comprehensive Testing:
Test all files to ensure each detection rule works correctly in different contexts.

## üìù Log Format

All logs follow **Apache/Nginx Combined Log Format**:
```
IP - - [timestamp] "METHOD /path HTTP/1.1" STATUS BYTES "-" "User-Agent"
```

Example:
```
192.168.1.50 - - [16/Oct/2024:14:23:12 +0000] "GET /products HTTP/1.1" 200 5432 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)"
```

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Clear your session** between tests (logout and login again)
2. **Use hard refresh** (Ctrl+Shift+R) if results look cached
3. **Check console** (F12) for any errors
4. **Compare results** between different files to see how detection varies
